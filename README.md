## About this project
Spanky's (full name Spanky's Mysterious Dice Rolling Game) is a text-based dice rolling game that is not as it seems. There are 5 endings, one that you must get via console and one that you must get by completing 4 / 5 endings.

`Cheater Ending`: Easiest to get, have a look through the SoM devlogs to find it!
`Lucky Ending`: Roll a natural 16 or above to get this ending.
`Determination Ending`: Win an odd/even roll at the end of the game.
`Attempted Ending`: Fail all rolls within the game.
`True Ending`: Collect all previous endings and press the enter key on "Flee" when it shows up.

Trust me, the True Ending is worth it :)

## Technical
Everything happens completely within the DOM and does not use any external libraries apart from jQuery.

## AI Usage
AI was not used to write big chunks of code - it is mostly hand written. The only exceptions are if I got stuck in certain places and requested AI help or for debugging purposes.
